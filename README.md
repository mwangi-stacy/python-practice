# python-practice

Mwangi, Stacy Njoki 160077
This repository is for all the code practice during the DSA Classes over the 1st Semester of the 2nd Year.

I attest to writing this code using my own logic with the use of AI materials and websites such as W3Schools and Udemy to obtain relevant information on various Python Programming Concepts.
